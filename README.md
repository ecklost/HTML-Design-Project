# Northeast Ohio Event Liaison (NOEL)
**_CISS 216 Project by: Eric Klostermeyer_**

## Strategy

The overall goal of the website is provide a public website where residents and visitors of North East Ohio a place to search, explore, and attend local events in the aforementioned area. Before continuing further, a definition is necessary. Northeast Ohio has eighteen counties to consider. For the purposes of this assignment, the focus will be on Lorain and Cuyahoga counties. Therefore, for the rest of this proposal, Northeast Ohio will refer to the two listed counties. After this semester, the scope of the area may increase beyond what is done for this assignment. 

It is my hope that the website will motivate people in the region to be more active in the community in regards to general events, plays, concerts, and sporting events. In particular, there are three activities the website will focus on: volunteering opportunities, entertainment such as music and sports (not limited to the major leagues), and general events which do not fall under the first two. The idea is for people to pursue activities beyond just staying at home. It is hoped that this will lead to further involvement with the community through volunteering or just being more active. 

One final goal is for organizations to advertise events. In this context, organizations can mean any non-politically motivated group and non-profits. Additionally, such groups may be able to find volunteering opportunities for them. One example is the Cleveland GiveCamp, a weekend long event where non-profits in the region can sign-up and have their websites made or redone.

In short, the prioritized goals of the website are:
1) Search, explore, and attend local events in the Lorain and Cuyahoga county.
2) Increase activity and community involvement in the region.
3) Advertise upcoming events especially for smaller organizations and non-profits. 

My rationale behind doing this website is often times, my girlfriend and I would want to get out of the house. However, we would have to search multiple websites that may or may not load, and/or may not have the type of activity we seek. Being able to search for an activity and sort through the ones we are interested in would be a great boon to us. Also, both of us would enjoy becoming more involved in the community.


## Personas

Note: No images were added here in case copyright comes into play.

Name: Gabriel Wallace

Age: 48

Occupation: Podcaster, Blogger, and stay at home dad

Reason for using the site: Gabriel makes podcasts for a respected news organization about events in the area. He has a deadline approaching. It’s summer so his kids are home and making a clamor to go somewhere. So, he uses the website to find children friendly activities in his area. Because he may need to be reached at any time, he is always on his phone.

**Goal 1**: He wants to find family-friendly events in the local area.

**Goal 2**: He also wants to find events on the go (mobile)

**Goal 3**: Potentially, this podcast will be about a summertime event he went to.

Name: Kathleen Dodson

Age: 39

Occupation: Life Guru and Alternative Medicine Seller

Reason for using the site: Kathleen started an online business selling green juice as a “miracle cure” and diet supplement. She has become widely successful, and has started branching out by having brick and mortar locations where she peddles her organic medicine and promotes her new Pilates exercise equipment. She is looking to expand into Cleveland and during a visit finds she has free time and uses the website to find activities within a specific time frame. 

**Goal 1**: She wants to find local events she is not aware about.

**Goal 2**: Potentially, she desires to set-up shops and invest in the local economy.

**Goal 3**: In the future, she wishes to entertain clients at other attractions coming up.

Name: Margo Sinclaire

Age: 20

Occupation: College Student

Reason for using the site: Margo has lived a culturally monotonous life. Recently, she’s been tasked by her art and history professors to do a report on events around town. For her art report, she needs to look at local artwork and do a report on that. Her history project involves learning about different cultures in town and how they interact with the city. In her spare time, she may want to go out and find her events her friends may be at.

**Goal 1**: Exploring ‘hip’ events around town in her area.

**Goal 2**: Immerse self in different cultures to grow as a person (become more well-rounded).

**Goal 3**: She wants to participate in more ‘artsy’ events, or just find avant-garde artwork for herself.


## Scope

A list of requirements are below. They are in no particular order and, ideally, all the requirements will be met. However, they may differ in priority depending on what is needed the most.

**_Requirement #1_**: Allow users to find events that pertain to them. Strictly speaking, the user should be able to refine, check on/off events for a given category (music, volunteering, etc.), and so forth. The user should be able to sort events through the use of check boxes and other parameters. 

**_Requirement #2_**: The website will be completely accessible and manageable through mobile devices and tablets. Therefore, progressive enhancement will be used as a basis.

**_Requirement #3_**: For the purposes of this project, the events will be hand-picked. Therefore, a system to find events is needed. If possible, a JavaScript or web crawler might work too.

**_Requirement #4_**: The user should be able to send an email or set a remainder of events they wish to see. The user does not have to sign-up for any newsletter or make an account to access this functionality.

**_Requirement #5_**: For each event, there should be tags that are associated with the event such as family-friendly, arts and crafts, popular, and so forth. 

**_Requirement #6_**: The links page should provide accurate and up-to-date links to websites. A general list of companies, organizations, etc. will be provided here with some selected and well-known on an about page. 

**_Requirement #7_**: Non-politically organizations and groups are allowed to suggest their event be uploaded to the website. Likewise, the inverse is possible e.g. someone can request their event taken down due to not enough people attending. Most directly, this will be offered through email.

**_Requirement #8_**: Allow users to see past events and plan accordingly for the next time the event happens. If an event is a one-time deal, a note should be made that the event may not be offered in the future.

**_Requirement #9_**: For each event, allow the user to navigate to the organization or website where an event originates. For example, if Gogol Bordello is coming back to perform, when the user clicks on the event in the music tab, they should be taken to the Agora/House of Blues website where they can find out more information and purchase tickets.

**_Requirement #10_**: Highlight and make special note of important and major events in the region on the home page. These events are strictly for family-friendly entertainment such as fireworks at Edgewater Park.

**_Requirement #11_**: Highlight volunteering efforts within an appropriate time frame on the home page.

**_Requirement #12_**: Highlight arts and cultural events on the home page.

**_Requirement #13_**: Holiday events may need to have their own page in order not to clog up some pages. Additionally, a special web page may need to be created from time to time in order to list events for that holiday. An example here would be listing fireworks at Edgewater Park, downtown Cleveland, Elyria, etc.

**_Requirement #14_**: For sporting events, extra information may be provided. For example, let’s say the Cleveland Indians are back from a road trip. Their current record and the starting pitcher for that game might be important for people. For a basketball game, information and details on if a player is out for a game might be used.


## Structure

The hierarchy for the website is as follows in the image below:

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/ecklost/HTML-Design-Project/blob/master/images/hierarchy.png">

The layout in the diagram provides the most logical approach to the web site. The boxes marked in blue use a ‘home page’ template; boxes in orange have a ‘main content’ or ‘event listing’ template; and the green boxes dictate a ‘text-heavy’ template. While the diagram doesn’t explicitly mention it, each web page can interact with one another because of the navigation each page will have. Since the majority of users will visit the website for events, those blocks are noted first. As the reader looks at the diagram from left to right, so to is the assumed importance of each page.  From top to bottom, the order goes main splash screen (home page), main pages, and then sub sections and web pages. As a final note, the entertainment page may not be used and just go straight to the three pages it is meant to lead to.


## Wireframe

In general, there are three types of pages for the website. The first is the home page (below). For this, I’m choosing a grid layout. There’s nothing out of the ordinary here. The header and navigation are at the top and neatly noted while the footer is naturally at the bottom. In between, each of the pages in the navigation is transformed into a block, and is easily read and clickable. Since most people are after events and entertainment, those two take precedence. Following that, links on volunteering and additional information on the website and links to other websites are mentioned. Note that the navigation and the way the blocks are listed are the same.

<img align="left" width=323 height=408 src="https://github.com/ecklost/HTML-Design-Project/blob/master/images/home.png">

The events, entertainment, and volunteering web pages are have the same header, navigation, and footer as mentioned before (below, left). The major difference is the content in the middle of the page. Initially, the user will only see ten items on the page. The user can choose and click on check boxes as needed to further refine their search. Ideally, these items will have the name, date and time, and location of the event. Additionally, upon loading the page to entertainment, the user will be greeted with three subsections – music, plays, and sports. Clicking on any of them will bring up the format listed above.

Finally, the third main page (below, right) is meant for information and articles. The content for this page will have the article in an L-shape with a small section on in the open area of the L. For this page, I intend to use it for the ‘About’ and ‘Links’ pages. The article lists the bulk of the content and is mainly what it says on the tin. The small, non-following section is a wild card, but most likely will contain three to five hand-picked events that are coming up.

<img align="left" width=323 height=408 src="https://github.com/ecklost/HTML-Design-Project/blob/master/images/event.png">

In short, I need three templates because each page has different content. One serves to lead people to other content (the home and entertainment page), one actually lists content (events, volunteering, and the three categorized entertainment pages), and one for text-heavy pages (the about and links pages). Each template is made for a specific purpose and is created to cater to that purpose.

Common elements found throughout all pages include grid design, content centered horizontally on the web page, justified text for articles, and same position for headers, navigation and footers.

## Prototypes

The HTML and CSS files can be found attached in the accompanying folder. They are titled, “index.html”, “event.html”, and “about.html”. In the future, it is hoped these will be used as templates, although, it is likely that quite a few elements will need to change.
