				<p> Welcome to Northeast Ohio Event Liaison (NOEL, pronounced No-el). This website is meant for people visiting or living in the Cleveland, OH area find events in their local area. As of now, the focus is on two countries in the area - Lorain and Cuyahoga county. In the future, it is to be hoped this website spreads beyond those two counties. 
				<p> The idea started with my partner and I discussing what to do on a Saturday afternoon. We wanted to get out of the house and do something whether it was volunteering, ethnic festivals, and so forth. However, it became clear that such events were difficult to hunt down. Worst of all was seeing an event that might be fun only to see the event was over or near over. Knowing events that would happen in the future would prevent this from happening! </p>
				<p> We set out three prioritized goals in mind for the website. The first is to search, explore, and attend local events in the area. Second, we also wanted to increase activity and community involvement in the region. Finally, advertising upcoming events is crucial, especially for smaller organizations and non-profits. </p>
				<p> As of now, all events are hand-picked and maintained by one person (myself). In the future, it is possible that a web crawler or tracker to websites be advisable. For this, a large collection of websites for organizations is necessary.</p>
				<p> Would you like to promote your event on here? Please send a message to: eklostermeyer@gmail.com. Already on here, but don't want to be? Let me know and I'll remove your organization from your list. Have suggestions? Send me an email! I'm always looking for feedback. </p>
